# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects.
These are some basic and small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

Car Approval
  This program has the user input certain information and can approve or deny a person based on the recieved information.

Daily Report
  This program copies the model used by The Tech Academy for a daily report done by students. It asks several questions and thanks the user for the input.

Student App
  This program creates a basic Entity Framework Code-First console application that creates a basic Student database and adds one student.

Car Insurance
   This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information
   and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes
   that have been issued.
